# Microboard.12-By-Daud
a simple micro board for hack club

THIS PROJECT IS OPENSOURCE, YOU CAN USE THE CODE AS YOU WISH.
Desinged for Hackclub


This is a simple pcb with a fusion 360 .step file to house a macropad.

*what does it do?*

well it can be customised to your liking, ex: Ctrl, Home, Pg up, etc.

this is meant to be a simple project to enhance my skills in areas like CAD and pcb desinging.
thanks for Hackclub's Amazing documentation to help me during the making of the macropad.
